# WatchCartoonsOnline-Downloader
Just a random idiotic downloader made by me.

Three steps in which the scraper/Downloader works

1:Gathers all the episodes links from a give season link '\n'.

2:From a single episode extract the link towars the iframe.

3:Using that iframe link extracts the link of the video.

And thats how the video is downloaded.Is'nt that quite simple :).
Well its not that much. In order to improve the performance of the scraper i had to use arsenic/async.
THis has made the code much more complex and i still have to do a lot more things also.

---TODO----

1: Make asynchronous version of the videoLinkExractor function i.e the getVideoLink() function.

2: Use the search function that i have made to search for some specific animes etc.

3: ............

4: ............
